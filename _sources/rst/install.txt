Installation
************

Instructions
============

Quick installation instructions.
|project| depends on several packages in order to function properly, apart from ``scipy`` and ``numpy``:

* `PyTables`_, a package for reading and writing files in the `HDF5 format`_.
* `python-progressbar`_, a package to display progress bars
* `Theano`_ will be used in future versions.

You may install those packages with ``pip`` by running the following command

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -r path/to/odelab/requirements.txt
    
The only package which might be problematic to install is ``PyTables``.
